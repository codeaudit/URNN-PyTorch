# Unitary RNN models

Include Tunable Efficient Unitary Recurrent Neural Networks(EURNN)[arXiv:1612.05231](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.05231.pdf) and Gated Orthogonal Recurrent Unit(GORU)[arXiv:1706.02761](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.02761.pdf).

Example task is language modeling from [PyTorch example](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/word_language_model)
